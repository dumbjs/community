# community 

`dumbjs` is a simple attempt to have straightforward javascript libraries, hence the name `dumb`. 

I've got a few ideas and plans that I wish for this org to do but for now this is just a place for the community to discuss about the following 

- **Future** - Things you wish were made by dumbjs
- **Q/A | Help** - Ask for resources, help, or guidance for the org with regards to tech and development
- **Feedback** - Let us know what you think about us or anything that we build
